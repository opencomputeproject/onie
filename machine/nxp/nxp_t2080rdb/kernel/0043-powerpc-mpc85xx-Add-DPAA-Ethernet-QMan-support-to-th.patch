+ *   device-tree, though in that case it will express all BPIDs, not just those
+ *   available for dynamic allocation.

+ * - Even for memory-backed resources that are software determined (FQIDs), this

+ *   partition that manages the device, so in AMP or hypervised scenarios there
+ *   may still be need to a way to provide allocation ranges. Ie. for O/S
