    # The problem we are trying to solve is:
    #
    #    How to determine the block device upon which to install ONIE?
    #
    # The question is complicated when multiple block devices are
    # present, i.e. perhaps the system has two hard drives installed
    # or maybe a USB memory stick is currently installed.  For example
    # the mSATA device usually shows up as /dev/sda under Linux, but
    # maybe with a USB drive connected the internal disk now shows as
    # /dev/sdb.
    #
    # The approach here is to look for the block device that has a
    # very specific, bus centric path in the system.  The internal
    # CFast device can only show up with this address.

    # Find the internal CFast device -- this path is specific to this platform
