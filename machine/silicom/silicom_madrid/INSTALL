Installing ONIE on Silicom Madrid
=================================

Cross-Compiling ONIE
====================

Change directories to ``build-config`` to compile ONIE.

To compile ONIE first change directories to ``build-config`` and then
type ``"make MACHINEROOT=../machine/silicom MACHINE=silicom_madrid all"``.
For example::

  $ cd build-config
  $ make -j4 MACHINEROOT=../machine/silicom MACHINE=silicom_madrid all

When complete, the ONIE binaries are located in ``build/images``::

* onie-recovery-x86_64-silicom_madrid-r0.iso -- This is the ONIE recovery
ISO image.  This image can be used to create a bootable USB memory stick
for installing/recovery ONIE.

* onie-updater-x86_64-silicom_madrid-r0 -- This is the ONIE self-update
image.  This image is a self-extracting archive used for installing ONIE.

* silicom_madrid-r0.initrd -- This is the ONIE kernel imag

* silicom_madrid-r0.vmlinuz -- This is the ONIE initramfs (filesystem)

Installing ONIE on a Blank Machine
==================================

To install ONIE on a new machine, you can use the recovery ISO image to
create a bootable USB memory stick.

Creating bootable USB stick
---------------------------

Use ``dd`` to copy the .iso image to a USB stick and boot from that::

  dd if=<machine>.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=10M

You can find the correct ``/dev/sdX`` by inspecing the ``dmesg``
output after inserting the USB stick into your work station.

Booting from USB stick
----------------------

1. Insert the USB stick

2. Power on the switch and press "ESC" when prompted to enter the boot menu

3. Select the option that corresponds to your USB stick

4. After several seconds, you should see:

                     GNU GRUB  version 2.02~beta2+e4a1fe391
